## Alerts
The crypto community is filled with scams and individuals seeking to take advantage - sadly the NewYorkCoin project is not immune and it has come to our attention that a copy cat website is being used to spread disinformation and drive traffic to Yobit - an exchange that is known to be trading NewYorkCoin with insufficient reserves due to a 51% attack and has locked withdrawals since the attack (with the exception of a short ~1 week period).

The fraudulent site is NewYorkCoin.net.
The fraudster also uses the twitter handle @NewYorkCoinNYC and goes by several aliases incuding nycminer, scryptenthusiast as well as hivewalletmind.

To bolster his scam the user is attacking the core dev team with easily disprovable accusations that malware was used to perform a 51% attack on NewYorkCoin while providing no evidence of how this is even possible.  At this time we know of no mechanism to use malware infected wallets to break consenses or generate sufficient hashrate to control an ASIC only PoW algorithm and there are no documented examples of this happening.  Conversely there are dozens of documented 51% attacks and all low hashrate PoW coins are vulnerable.  

Unrelated to 51% attacks are the rather common malware injection attacks on crypt repositories on github.  The core dev team has taken all necessary steps to lock down the github repo by enforcing 2-factor authentication, limiting the number of team members with access to the organization and using our own custom discord bot to monitor https://api.github.com/repos/NewYorkCoin-NYC/nycoin/releases for unauthorized changes since the tools provided by GitHub were, at least at the time, insufficient.

For a better understanding of the 51% attack see https://medium.com/@newyorkcoin/timeline-analysis-and-response-to-recent-51-attack-941da50d625c
